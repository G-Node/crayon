# Crayon

### Dynamic, colourful, evented time-series plotting

*Crayon* is a small, free JavaScript library that makes it trivially
easy to create dynamic plots of time-series (charts).  It uses SVG to
handle graphics and has smooth transitions when additional signals,
spikes etc. are added.

### Vocabulary
Crayon is written for the easy plotting of electrophysiological data.
As such, it has a vocabulary particularly suited to electrophysiology.
You will find, however, that this vocabularly can be mapped to any
kind of application field easily. 

### Dependencies
Crayon depends on [data-driven-documents (d3)][1] and [jquery][2]
during runtime.  To reuse both libraries, neither is compiled into
crayon.js.  You can include them in your html page as shown in the
examples.
